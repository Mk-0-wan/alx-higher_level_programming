## 0x02-python-import_modules üö¢:
* This project will help you on how to work with multiple files and importing their functions in your pyhton project
* Understanding how to work with modules in python is a very crucial part in python programming for it sets up a foundation for ease of working with huge projects later on
* Have fun learn it the pythonic way

## Tools :toolbox:
* Must have `git` and `python3.8` installed
* Operating system `Ubuntu 20.04`
* How to install them look [**here**](https://github.com/Mk-0-wan/alx-higher_level_programming/README.md)

## Tips ü´∞üèø
* There are different ways to import a module in python
   ```python
   #!/usr/bin/pyth0n3
   import os
   os = os.write(1, b"Hello, World")
   # or
   os = __import__("os").write(1, b"Hello, World")
   ```
* Also you can use an if statement inside a print statement
   ```python
   #!/usr/bin/python3
   for i in range(0, 5):
     print("{} is even".format(i), end=' ' if (i % 2 == 0) else "\n")
   ```
* There are more tips inside the files themselves this is just a tip of the iceberg
